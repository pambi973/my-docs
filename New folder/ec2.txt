AWS EC2 instance two healthy checks named as
1 System Reachability Check, which confirms that AWS is able to get the network packets to the userâ€™s instance.

AMI amazon machine image:

types of AMI
1 Quick start -amazon
2 My AMIS- my backup
3 AWS market place- third party
4 community AMIS -amazon

Instance type

majarly we will go with general purpose family

at a time we can launch 5 instance

by default we will launch on demand server we will launch
we will not launch spot instance.

storage types need to search

snapchat is nothig but taking backup for c or d drives or root volumes in linux

security
 source 
myip
anywhere
custom

some imp ports for devops engineer
linux ssh 22
rdp windows 3389
tomcat 8080
jenkins 8080
jboss 8080
sonacube 9000

with out pem key we cant log in to first time for aws server


after that we disable pem key and adding password



instance life cycle

                      pending

               stopped------stopping-------running-----------rebooting






private
192.168.0.0
10.0.0.0
172.16.0.0
remaining are pubilc ip

server launching time private ip will create first

must learn system performance commands


mstsc command to open remote desktop for windows files.
------------------------------------------

while attaching volumes we need to stop running instances 

--------------------------------------------------
how to copy files from ec2 to s3 or s3 to ec2

need to attach role from ec2 to s3
actions
change instance settings
attach or replace iam role
add policy to that role
aws s3 cp sorce dest --recursive
aws s3 cp . s3://bucket name/folder  --recursive

we can modify the root volume of server it means goto ebs volumes 
and select the server and modify volume  roboot ur system
-------------------------------------------

can we attach root volume of one server to root volume of another server same az

1 create EC2 instance

2 take a snapchat
 delete ec2 instance

3 convert snapchat into volume

4 select other ec2 instance

5 stop the instance

6 delete root volume in volumes 

7 attach this volume as root volume

---------------------------------------
steps to launch ec2 instance
1 chose AMI
2 choose instance type
3 configure instance
4 add storage
5 add tags
6 configure security group
7 launch instance

how to trouleshoot instance 

check whether health checks status
check port no is open or not
check for which ip is this open to acess

if it is a web server check services was started or not

---------------------------
we cant copy volumes from one region to other region

but we can create volume to snapchat and we can copy snapchat from one instance to other instance

we can create AMI from snapchat and we can copy to our region
---------------------------------------
we can take automatically snapchat with life cycle manager in EBS volumes

create iam role
