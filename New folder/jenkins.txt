jenkins is ci/cd tool written in jenkins
open source
its a cross platform tool
plugin based tool

what is CI?
CI is nothing but when there is any commits occured in our version control tools the build will trigger automatically.
what is CD?
Continous Delivery means deploying code from lover environemt to production environment is called continous delivery. continous 

No of stages of environment
1 Development
2 QA
3 UAT user acceptance testing 
4 Staging environment repilica to production
5 production environment production
--------------------
what is the difference between hudson and jenkins
on top of hudson they are created jenkins
-----------------------
types of jenkins jobs
1 freestyle project - we can create any type of projects here
2 mvn project - it will excutes mvn projects only
3 external job - job will be excuted by external machine like nodes
4 multi configuration job - means job will run parallely even though we have enough excuters
5 Multi barnching job -
6 pipe line job - we will create our jobs using pipelines here
----------------------------------
jenkins homepage
1 new item -creating new job
2 people -to know how many are avalible with your jenkins
3 build history - history all builds
4 manage jenkins -
5 credentials -
---------------------------
in /root we will have .jenkins directories 
in .jenkins we have jobs,updates,logs

in windows c programfiles
users jenkins path

in windows download jenkins.war file
java -jar jenkins.war to install jenkins

-------------------
manage Jenkins contains
1 configure system
 system message
 no of excuters
 Lables is used for nodes
 queit period is nothing but our next job will run after quiet period ends -job to job 
poll scm will continously look for your refered repository
best practise is quiet period = poll scm or less than
-----------------------------------
2 configure global security
cd /etc shadow is the data base for unix users
jenkins having own data base
autherization
a) any one can do any thing- disabling security
b) legacy mode - old archetecture
c) loged in users can do anything - read acess for all but loged one can do anything
d)matrix based security- we can enable security for all jobs
e) project based security - we can eanble security for projects
f) role based security -  here we create roles and after we will assigne roles to users
--------------------------------------
some importantplugin in jenkins
green balls
html publisher
git
maven
---------------------------
Global security

1 Authentication
2 Autherization


Authentication types

1 delegate to servlet container
2 jenkins own user data base
3 LDAp
4 Unix user/group data base having data base /etc/shadow

 Autherization types

1 any one  can do  anything
2 legacy mode
3 logged in users can do anything
4 matrix based security
5 project based matrix autherization strategy
6 role based security
--------------------------


--------------------------------------------------
Difference between matrix based and project based matrix authorization and role based authorization
 
matix based authrization users will get overall permissions to jobs
but in preoject we can restrict the users for jobs

role based startgies
here we will create roles
we will add users to the roles
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
can we change jenkins home directory yes

EXPORT JENKINS_HOME=/root/jenkins
and restart the server.
you need do at starting of the jenkins
user information will lose job information will lose

---------------------------------------------------
safe restart wil be done after completetion of all jobs

if a deveoper is not having build acess for job, how he can excute job

no,but if a admin can change job configuration to job  any one can excute job

by default jenkins session time out is 30 min

but we can increase web.xml in web-inf directiory in .jenkins


----------------------------------------------
plugins use cases
 
1 green ball plugin
2 nested view plugin to create directory inside developerbuilds,QA builds
3 role based startagie pluin
4 rebuilder plugin
when there is parameterized build if it fails we can run build with out giving parameters.
5  Muilti Branch pipline  used to build from multiple branches inone scm
6 job import plugin we can import job configuration
7 ssh agent 
------------------------------------------------
Creation of job consists
1 general
2 SCM
3 Build triggers
4 Build Environment
5 Build
6 post Build actions

1 general contains

1 Description
2 Discard old builds
3 this project is parameterized
4 throttle bilds - we can manage  count of builds  
5 disble this project -
6 Excute concurent build if necessary- we can build same job parallely
7 


Build triggers
a) trigger builds remotely
token name
b) Build other projects  are built
Creating upstream project here

c) Build Periodically
d) Build when a change is pushed to github
e) Poll SCM
--------------------------------------------------
not possible to take scm from to tools like svn and git


----------------------
to change jenkins port number
sudo vim /etc/sysconfig/jenkins
systemctl jenkins restart

in windows
program files
jenkins
jenkins.xml

-----------------------------------------------------
pipe line in jenkins

1 declarative
2 scripting
the basic difference between declatative between these two are declarative is simple and user understads
 the scripted pipeline is a traditional way of writing the code.
Declative starts with pipeline

scripted starts with node
--------------------------------------------------
Structure and syntax of the Declarative pipeline:

The Agent is where the whole pipeline runs. Example, Docker. The Agent has following parameters:

any – Which mean the whole pipeline will run on any available agent.

none – Which mean all the stages under the block will have to declared with agent separately.

label –  this is just a label for the Jenkins environment

docker –  this is to run the pipeline in Docker environment.


EX:

pipeline{
  agent{ label 'node-1' } 
  stages{
    stage ('SCM') {
      steps {
        git 'githublink'
      }
     }
     stage('compile') {
       tools{
         maven 'maven3.6.1'
       }
       steps{ 
           sh 'maven Clean install'
       }
     }
  }
}

can we run paralle stage also example is like   

Jenkinsfile
pipeline {
    agent none
    stages {
        stage('Run Tests') {
            parallel {
                stage('Test On Windows') {
                    agent {
                        label "windows"
                    }
                    steps {
                        bat "run-tests.bat"
                    }
                    post {
                        always {
                            junit "**/TEST-*.xml"
                        }
                    }
                }
                stage('Test On Linux') {
                    agent {
                        label "linux"
                    }
                    steps {
                        sh "run-tests.sh"
                    }
                    post {
                        always {
                            junit "**/TEST-*.xml"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Scroll down and click on Post-build action button and select Publish JUnit test result report option.

--------------------------------------------------++
Multijob pipeline

we can configure multiple jobs here

we you run this job automatically all the jobs you configured jobs will be build parallely
-----------------------------------------------
copying jobs from one jenkins server to other servers

if u want job in one server to other server u need to copy the config.xml file in jobs directory to other server jobs directory by using scp command
-----------------------------------------------
copy aritifact plugin

we can copy artifact of other job to my current job

in my current job we need to goto build action 

in build actions we have copy artifacts

-----------------------------------

Backup in jenkins 

we can take buckup jenins by using two steps one is instaling plugin called thin-backup
and then 
go with

to take backup of jobs

we will schedule on cronjob 

steps to take it

crontab -e
* * * * * scriptname

script

#!/bin/bash
src = path
dest = path
