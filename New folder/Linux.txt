difference between shell and kernel

shell is mediater between user and kernel

kernel base version for linux





--------------

umask values 0022 for root user 0002 for normal user

is it possible to change umask value

777 dir 666 for file default permissions

to set umask value umask 222

how to set umask value permanantley for the specific user
 
/home/ec2-user
.bash_profile

you need to add umask value in .bash profile

how to set umask value permanantley for the all users

/etc/profile

uptime uptime of server

free -m ram space
difference etween free and df -h 
free will give ram usage df will give memory ususage

difference between find and grep commands

find will search file in directory 
grep will search a string in file

find . -type f -ls |grep '2017'

-------------------------------
directory structure of linux

/= root directory imp directory

home contains the users info
bin:binary files normal user can acess
sbin: binary files root user can acess
etc: all config files
lib: libraries
opt: used to install third party tools git maven sonarcube tomcat
proc: process info.. cpuinfo

root user home directory is /root


what is indoe

The inode (index node) is a data structure in a Unix-style file system that describes a file-system object such as a file or a directory. Each inode stores the attributes and disk block locations of the object's data.
to change permision or giving ownership to others for directory

command
chown -R username:groupname directoryname

---------------------------------------------
Some Linux commands

touch to create empty file
ls -la all files in directory

command to show empty files in current directory
find . -type f -empty
find . -type d -empty d means directory

find . -type f -ls |grep '2017'

-----------------------------------------
SCP command Secure copy if you want copy files from across the servers

scp filename username@ip:path

for directory
scp  -R directoryname username@ip:path

Cut Command:
The cut command in UNIX is a command for cutting out the sections from each line of files and writing the result to standard output.
Ex:
$ cut state.txt
cut: you must specify a list of bytes, characters, or fields
Try 'cut --help' for more information.

cut -c 1-3 filename

cut -d ":" -f 1 filename

man
uname

AwK command
Awk is a scripting language used for manipulating data and generating reports.The awk command programming language requires no compiling, and allows the user to use variables, numeric functions, string functions, and logical operators.
WHAT CAN WE DO WITH AWK ?

1. AWK Operations:
(a) Scans a file line by line
(b) Splits each input line into fields
(c) Compares input line/fields to pattern
(d) Performs action(s) on matched lines


awk '{print $0}' .txt
awk '{print $1,$3}' .txt
awk '{print NR $0}' .txt


----------------------------
free -m to check how much ram storage is avalible

------------------------------

what is file system
file system is a collection of files and directories 
types
1 disc based
2 network based
3 virtualor memory based
what is disc based

ext2/ext3/ext4/xfs are the disc based file systems using in liux

whats is network based file sysytem

nfs is used by linux for sharing linux for sharing files and directories

virtual or memory based file systems
swap memory by linux


------------------------------

in linux 1-64 
windows c-z logical we can create

-----------------------------------------
creating empty files

touch

cat is the command to show data in file

cat file name

cat >> file name

cat -n file name
file displays with numbers

we can append or add data to the file

vi(virtual editor)
vi is the power full we can create+add+delete the file  
vi commands
esc i to insert
esc q to quit
esc wq! to save and quit
esc yy copyline
esc n yy copy n lines
esc dd delete line
esc n dd delete n lines
esc shift D delete line at cursor
esc r replace a charactor
esc x delete single character
esc u to undo
esc dy to delete filed
esc shift h to move head cursor
esc shif m to middle
esc shift g to last
esc shift :set nu to add line numbers
esc shift :set nonu to delete line numbers
esc shift:line mumer
esc sift: /text to search text in file

------------------------------------------------
ls commands
ls -a display hidden files
ls -d display all directories
ls -m it will display all files and directories with comma
ls -s display the size of the file
ls -i display inode numbers of the file


--------------------------------
Absolte path means providing total path from root
relative path means creating files from current directory
----------------------------------------
Some important filter commands

More- display file in page by page
less- display file in page by page from below
sort- sort lines in alphabetic order
wc- count no lines,characters,words
wc filename
wc -l filename
wc -c filename
wc -w filename

Head it will display default top 10 lines
tail it will display default 10 lines from bottom

ps -ef to check how many process running by the system

-----------------------------------------------

Disk management or File managemet

how many disk are avalible 
fdisk -l  

fdisk diskname

it will opens disk with partion table along with command prompt

command (m for help): n for creating new partition
enter first cylinder number: no
last cylindr no: u can give no or size(+sizeM or K or G)
command: p
to show how many partiotions in the disk

command : w to save and exit from the partition disk

need to save patition in the disk
need to run this command two times
or otherwise we need to reboot ur device
partx -a /dev/sda
partx -a /dev/sda

need to format the created partition
commands : mkfs.ext4  partition name(/dev/sda6)

mount the partition

 need to create one directry

mkdir /directory name

mount partition name /directory name -temporary
for permanant 
vi /etc/fstab
need to enter details
partition name  directory filesystem defaults 0 0
unmount /oracle
mount /oracle
now it will be mounted permantly

to see the mounted partition size
df -h  

sudo shutdown -r to reboot our system in linux

-------------------------
fields in fstab

1 partition name
2 directory name
3 file system
4 permissions
5 fs dump value
6 fsck pass value

we can create label name for partitions
e2label partition name - it will show label name

u want create label name e2label partitionname labelname

to permenant it
vi /etc/fstab
partition name place LABEL=laelname
----------------------------------------------
A symbolic or soft link is an actual link to the original file, whereas a hard link is a mirror copy of the original file. If you delete the original file, the soft link has no value, because it points to a non-existent file. But in the case of hard link, it is entirely opposite. Even if you delete the original file, the hard link will still has the data of the original file. Because hard link acts as a mirror copy of the original file.

soft link will work across the file system across c and d drives  but in case of hard link it will not work

----------------------------------------------------- 
linux os has 4 booting phases

1) bios phase
2) osloader phase
3) kernel phase
4) init phase

Bios phase 

-----------------------------------------------------
what is run level 

run level is a software program under which some group of  services and process will exists

init 0 shutdown the system
init 1 single usermode
init2 multi user mode without nfs(network file system)
init3 multi user mode with nfs(full text mode and we are using)
init4  un used
init5 GUI
init6 restart

to check present run level of system 
who -r

init6
cat /etc/passwd to check users in system
----------------------------------------
Group Management
group is collection of users

we have two types of groups

1 primary - if the user is present in one group
2 secondary - if the user is present in one or more groups is called secondary

group id s in linux

0-99 system groups
100-499 deamon groups
500-60000 user defined groups

to check the groups 

cat /etc/groups

to create group 
groupadd name id 

to assign passwd to group

gpasswd name

cat /etc/gshaow 
consists of group passwds

do u want change group id
groupmod -g 600 530
group -n new name old name
groupdel groupname
grpck to check errors in group

user can login to 16 other groups along with primary group

user cant loginto the system if edidnot have primary 

useradd command default will give group home directory shell

it will read from cat /etc/default/useradd


what are the fields in cat /etc/shadow

1 usename
2 encrypted passwd
3 date of password change(keep in days when kernel started)
4 min days passwd expiry
5 Max daays passwd expiry
6 warning
7 0 
8 

what are fields cat /etc/passwd 
1 usernam
2 x 
3 userid
4 group id
5 home directory of user
6 user shell

id users name give in how many grous user having will give
